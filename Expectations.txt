This game is meant to be a learning tool. This game is also a very accurate depiction of what my semester has been like
taking college level calculus. When you decide to play the game you will be moving your character around a map (level) that
is dependent on the amount of experience points you have. Starting a new game you will have 0 experience points and thus
start at the beginning.

Everytime that you move around the map you will have to solve a very simple arithmetic. Everytime that you succesfully
complete a task while movign around the map you will gain experience points. You must obtain a certian amount of experience 
points to be able to fight the boss that is at the end of every level. 

The types of math problems are more difficult while fighting the boss than just traveling around the maps. The first boss,
the types of tasks are a variety of arithmetic that will challenge your PEMDAS expertise. The second boss, the types of tasks
are factoring algebraic problems. The third boss, the types of tasks are finding the derivative of the presented function. The 
final boss you are meant to find the antiderivative of a presented function. If you are thinking that the level of math goes
from extremely easy to quite difficult, well....welcome to my experience of college calculus. 

There are some upgrades that can make this game a bit easier going. When starting a new game you have no upgrades. If you land
on a position of the map with a U on it, you will be able to purchase upgrades. The upgrades can aid you and some can give you
a perception of aid. You will have to learn this by experience.

Good luck out there! Remember you can do this!
